In the following steps, we will create a workflow - [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) -
for [automatic continuous integration](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) of the project.
This ensures that building a functional application from the source code is possible outside our development environment.

### Automated Tests

A part of continuous integration is also ensuring that newly added code is functional and does not affect
existing and implemented functionality. This verification is provided by automated tests,
which are executed after every publication of changes in the source code.

>warning:> In this exercise, we focus on testing only marginally, more from the perspective of how to automate continuous integration. Therefore, the tests are only illustrative, and their added value is low. Nevertheless, in a real project, it is necessary to pay considerable attention to automated tests, preferably with the [Test Driven Development][tdd] method. Ignoring the creation of automated and reliable tests is likely to result in increased maintenance and innovation costs for the software project, which, due to neglecting the creation of automated tests in practice, are exponentially higher than typical costs for proactive creation of automated test suites. The lack of automated tests manifests not only in the emergence of unexpected errors but also in deteriorated design quality and reduced interoperability between individual components of the entire software work.

If we now perform automated tests in our project

```ps
npm test
```

we will find that they are not functional and fail with an error message like:

```plain
Jest encountered an unexpected token

Jest failed to parse a file. This happens e.g. when your code or 
its dependencies use non-standard JavaScript syntax, or when Jest 
is not configured to support such syntax.
```

This error is caused by the fact that while the `@material/web` library already fully utilizes the new [JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) standard, the [Jest] library, which our project uses for running tests, needs to be configured for this standard. Currently, the simplest way to import external web components is to import them in a so-called [global script](https://stenciljs.com/docs/config#globalscript), thereby placing the list of external web components in one place. We will show the configuration adjustment when integrating the [Axios] library, which we will need to connect to the REST API server.

>build_circle:> If you see errors when executing the command that refer to Puppeteer or Chrome, please refer to [this guide](../99.Problems-Resolutions/02.puppeteer.md) for solving Puppeteer issues.

1. Create the file `${WAC_ROOT}/ambulance-ufe/src/global/app.ts` and place the imports of problematic modules in it, and export an empty function:

```ts
import '@material/web/list/list' 
import '@material/web/list/list-item'
import '@material/web/icon/icon' 

export default function() { // or export default async function() 
  // package initialization code 
}  
```

In the file `${WAC_ROOT}/ambulance-ufe/src/components/pfx-ambulance-wl-list/pfx-ambulance-wl-list.tsx`, remove the relevant lines with the import of `@material/web/...` modules:

```ts
import { Component, Host, h } from '@stencil/core';
import '@material/web/list/list'  @_remove_@
import '@material/web/list/list-item'   @_remove_@
import '@material/web/icon/icon' @_remove_@

...
```

Next, modify the file `${WAC_ROOT}/ambulance-ufe/stencil.config.ts` to include a reference to this global script:

```ts
...
export const config: Config = {
  globalScript: 'src/global/app.ts', @_add_@
  ...
}
```

and finally, run the tests again:

```ps
npm test
```

During this run, you should see that the expectations of the test `<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list â€º renders` are not met, leading to the failure of the automated test run. Now, we need to modify the test so that its expectations are met.

2. Modify the unit test in the file `${WAC_ROOT}/ambulance-ufe/src/components/<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list/test/<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list.spec.tsx`:


```ts
import { newSpecPage } from '@stencil/core/testing';
import { <Pfx>AmbulanceWlList } from '../<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list';

describe('<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list', () => {
    it('renders', async () => {
      const page = await newSpecPage({
          components: [<Pfx>AmbulanceWlList],
          html: `<<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list></<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list>`,
      });

      const wlList = page.rootInstance as PfxAmbulanceWlList; @_add_@
      const expectedPatients = wlList?.waitingPatients?.length @_add_@

      const items = page.root.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll("md-list-item"); @_add_@
      expect(items.length).toEqual(expectedPatients); @_add_@
      . @_empty_line_@
      expect(page.root).toEqualHtml(`  @_remove_@
        <pfx-ambulance-wl-list>  @_remove_@
          <mock:shadow-root>  @_remove_@
            <slot></slot> @_remove_@
          </mock:shadow-root> @_remove_@
        </pfx-ambulance-wl-list> @_remove_@
      `); @_remove_@
    });
});
```

3. Verify that our test suite is functional and passes without errors by running the command in the `${WAC_ROOT}/ambulance-ufe` directory:

```ps
npm test
```

![Successful Run of Automated Tests](./img/030-02-SuccessTest.png)

and then archive our changes with the commands:


```ps
git add .
git commit -m "unit tests"
git push
```

After this modification, the test can be mapped to the requirement: _Each of the waiting patients is displayed in the `<pfx>-ambulance-wl-list` component as an `md-list_item` type entry_. In practice, the goal is to have all requirements and all decision branches in the application code mapped through automated tests. Ideally, we would start with a predefined (or _conscious_) requirement, for which we would implement a test as described in step 2, and through subsequent implementation, we would strive to achieve successful test execution. This approach is called [Test Driven Development][tdd] and is one of the most effective ways to ensure the quality of a software piece.

### Creating GitHub Workflow for Automated Integration

When creating a specification for continuous integration, we can start either on the [GitHub] page in our repository, or create and edit it directly in our development environment. In both cases, the specification will be located in the `.github/workflows` directory in our repository. In this section, we will create a specification on the [GitHub] page and later edit it in our own development environment.
The specification can contain many different steps (_Actions_), many of the more complex tasks are already prepared and can be searched on the [Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)

1. Open the [Github] page, go to your `ambulance-ufe` repository, and click on the _Actions_ item in the top bar. In the _Search workflow_ field, enter `node.js` and confirm. In the resulting list, press the _Configure_ button in the box named _Node.js_.

![Select GitHub Workflow](./img/030-03-SelectWorkflow.png)

2. The page with the file `ambulance-ufe/.github/workflows/node.js.yml` will appear. In the file name field, rename this file to `ci.yml`.

3. In the first part of the file, you see the name of the workflow, which is in this case `Node.js CI`. You can change this name to `Ambulance UFE CI`, which will help you better identify the source of problems in case of alerts when the continuous integration fails.


```yaml
name: Ambulance uFE CI
```

Next is a set of triggers for the workflow. In this state, they specify that continuous integration will be performed on commits to the main branch, as well as when creating `pull-request` requests on this branch, and also when assigning a tag starting with the text `v1`. This ensures that the main branch will always contain a verified version of the application. Assigning a tag, for example, `v1.0.0` allows us to specify that this version is stable and can be used to generate an official release. A detailed description of possible triggers can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).

```yaml
...
on:
push:
  branches: [ "main" ]
  tags:  @_add_@
  - 'v1*'  @_add_@
pull_request:
  branches: [ "main" ]
...
```

The continuous integration specification follows. The `jobs` section contains individual sets of tasks that must be executed - _jobs_ can run in parallel on different devices, while one job typically runs sequentially on one allocated device. The type of device on which this specification should run is determined by its property `runs-on`; in our case, it is `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`. The device type in this case describes the operating system, but it is not a condition. It can, for example, describe whether the device has a graphics processor or specify custom host resources with specific properties or roles. More about standard devices can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

The `strategy` block allows executing a set of tasks described in this _job_ with all combinations of variables listed in this section. In our case, it is only one variable `node-version`, which contains a list of Node.js versions to be used when performing tasks. This is useful, especially when creating packages that can then be used in different environments and configurations that we could verify in this way. For our application, we do not have such a requirement, and in the case of continuous integration, we focus on the goal of quick feedback with frequent changes in the source code. Modify this section to include only one version of Node.js - in this case, any version from the major releases 20.x:

```yaml
...
strategy:
  matrix:
    node-version: [ 20.x ] @_important_@
...
```

>info:> The `strategy` section can also be completely removed; in that case, the workflow will be executed only once, with the default Node.js version.

The `steps` section contains a list of tasks to be performed. In our case, these are the steps:
* `actions/checkout@v3`, which fetches the current state of our repository;
* `actions/setup-node@v3`, which installs or prepares the environment for the specified Node.js version;
* command line steps that execute the commands `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`. The `ci` option is equivalent to the `install` option without checking for package presence in the cache.

The provided steps meet our requirements, so we don't need to modify them. The entire workflow looks like this:


```yaml
name: Ambulance uFE CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    tags:
    - 'v1*'
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
```

4. Archive the changes on the GitHub page by pressing the _Commit changes_ button. You can leave the change comment in the displayed dialog unchanged.

![Archiving CI Workflow](./img/030-04-CommitCI.png)

5. Since we last committed to the `main` branch, continuous integration, based on the triggers we specified, will automatically run. Still on the [GitHub] page, select the _Actions_ tab in the top bar. In the _All Workflows_ list, you should see the currently running or completed run of the _Ambulance uFE CI_ workflow, named after the commit:

![CI Workflow Run](./img/030-05-WorkflowRun.png)

Wait for the integration to finish successfully.

6. As you have noticed, a new continuous integration workflow is actually represented by a new YAML file, `ci.yml`, which is part of the source code version archive. Let's synchronize our local repository with the following commands:

```ps
git fetch
git pull
```

After executing these commands, you can find and edit the mentioned file in your local repository at `${WAC_ROOT}/ambulance-ufe/.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

>info:> In Visual Studio Code, you can install the [GitHub Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-github-actions) extension, which allows you to monitor the status of continuous integration directly in the VSCode environment and provides enhanced support for editing workflow specification files.
