## Solution to Technical Issues during Exercise Work

We have designed the exercises in a way that should enable their smooth execution on most operating systems. Due to the diversity of environments we encounter, it is possible that some of the known technical issues may arise in your case. We explicitly mention some of them in individual chapters. This section summarizes specific problems that we are aware of and provides procedures for addressing these issues.

However, if you encounter any other problems while working on the exercises, we would appreciate it if you could bring them to our attention.
