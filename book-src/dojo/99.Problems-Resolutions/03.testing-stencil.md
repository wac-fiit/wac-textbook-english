## Issues with Automated Tests

### Error `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`

The most common error when executing automated tests is a combination of libraries that fully utilize the new ECMAScript module loading standard. However, this standard is still in the process of implementation in browsers, and some libraries only partially utilize it. One such library is [Jest], which is used for running automated tests, and it supports ECMAScript Modules [experimentally](https://jestjs.io/docs/ecmascript-modules).

In the chapter [Automated Integration](../01.Web-Components/003-ci.md), we circumvent this error by loading libraries that already assume support for ECMAScript modules in a global script. This approach works when using other web components but can be problematic when our code has a direct dependency on libraries that already support ECMAScript modules. In such cases, an alternative approach is necessary.

One possible solution is to use [babel-jest](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/tree/main/packages/babel-jest#setup) to transpile the code into an older version of JavaScript. However, when combined with StencilJs, this method may not work seamlessly. Therefore, it is more suitable to create an independent set of tests executed by a separately configured Jest.
