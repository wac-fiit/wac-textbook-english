##### API

Abbreviation for _Application Programmable Interface_

##### Application Programmable Interface

Application interface for control using an external program. Unlike
the user interface, this interface is typically available to users with
knowledge of the relevant technology or programming language. It assumes
parameter initialization and result processing through technical means.
Important characteristics of an API include documentation quality, availability, and portability.

##### Cloud

The term _Cloud_ is a borrowed word that originally expressed any computational
resources between a computer or computers of a software service provider,
where the server part of the software system runs, and a computer on which
the user interface (front-end) runs. In technical diagrams for client-server solutions,
this part was typically illustrated as a little cloud, hence the term _cloud_ in English,
indicating the resources of the Internet network infrastructure. A _cloud_ solution
means that the resources on the service provider's side have moved into this
"cloud," which in practice involves using and renting computing resources in a public
data center. However, over time, the term has acquired various meanings, such as
"_private cloud_," "_my cloud_," and similar. In the technical environment,
the use of the term _public data center_ in English is preferred to refer to the _cloud_,
and the term _on-premise data center_ for resources under personal management.

##### CORS

See _Cross-Origin Resource Sharing_

##### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

CORS describes the way a server uses additional headers to inform
a web application from one server (_origin_) that it can access selected resources
from another server (_different origin_).

##### Public Data Center

In English, _public data center_, also see _Cloud_. Computational resources provided
by a third party and, in certain aspects, shared among different providers
of software services and solutions.
